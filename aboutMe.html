        <h2>Schooling and 🎓Education</h2>
        <p>After finishing elementary school in Banja Luka, I wasn’t quite sure which path to take next.
            For some reason, I decided to pursue economics and enrolled at Pitagora High School in Odžaci,
            where I completed my studies as an economics technician. However, I didn’t feel fulfilled in economics,
            and soon started exploring other options. I considered a career in law enforcement due to my lifelong passion for martial arts.
            Yet, something shifted, and I chose to study at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Banja Luka,
            specializing in Software Engineering under the Department of Computing and Informatics.
            Currently, I’m in my third year of undergraduate studies and feel confident that I’ve chosen the right field,
            as I enjoy learning new technologies and working with programming..

        <h2>Currently</h2>
        <p>"After mastering the fundamentals of C/C++ and Java at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering (ETF UNIBL), where I developed a passion for memory management and high-performance systems, 
            I decided to broaden my horizons toward modern Web Technologies.
            My academic background in computer architecture and networks provided a solid base, but I am now focused on integrating those low-level insights with a modern full-stack approach. Through independent learning and hands-on projects, I have gained proficiency in React, Node.js, and Docker.
            Following a productive DevOps internship at m:tel, where I applied my knowledge in a professional environment, my current goal is to find a dedicated team and mentor. I am eager to apply my diverse skill set—ranging from system-level optimization to real-time web applications—to impactful real-world projects as I complete my final year of studies."

        <h2>No man has rights to be an amateur when it comes to physical training..</h2>
        <p>For eight years, I trained in judo, a sport that has helped me develop discipline and resilience.
            Although I no longer train as intensely, I occasionally refresh my skills.
            After judo, I moved on to kickboxing, a sport I still train in regularly, along with weightlifting at the gym.
            Physical activity is more than a hobby for me – it’s a way of life.
            Besides martial arts, I have a creative hobby – playing the guitar.
            Music is a great way to relax and connect with others, helping me find a balance between intellectual and physical pursuits.
