        <h2>Schooling and ðŸŽ“Education</h2>
        <p>After finishing elementary school in Banja Luka, I wasnâ€™t quite sure which path to take next.
            For some reason, I decided to pursue economics and enrolled at Pitagora High School in OdÅ¾aci,
            where I completed my studies as an economics technician. However, I didnâ€™t feel fulfilled in economics,
            and soon started exploring other options. I considered a career in law enforcement due to my lifelong passion for martial arts.
            Yet, something shifted, and I chose to study at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Banja Luka,
            specializing in Software Engineering under the Department of Computing and Informatics.
            Currently, Iâ€™m in my third year of undergraduate studies and feel confident that Iâ€™ve chosen the right field,
            as I enjoy learning new technologies and working with programming..

        <h2>Currently</h2>
        <p>Alongside my studies at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, where Iâ€™m learning about various aspects of computing,
            I decided to expand my knowledge in the field of web development. Recognizing the high demand for this profession,
            I aim to position myself as an expert in this area.
            Iâ€™m currently working on projects that help me build skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
            and Iâ€™m gradually becoming familiar with more advanced tools and frameworks.
            My goal is to gain enough practical experience to secure a job as a web developer after graduation,
            allowing me to apply my knowledge in real-world projects.

        <h2>No man has rights to be an amateur when it comes to physical training..</h2>
        <p>For eight years, I trained in judo, a sport that has helped me develop discipline and resilience.
            Although I no longer train as intensely, I occasionally refresh my skills.
            After judo, I moved on to kickboxing, a sport I still train in regularly, along with weightlifting at the gym.
            Physical activity is more than a hobby for me â€“ itâ€™s a way of life.
            Besides martial arts, I have a creative hobby â€“ playing the guitar.
            Music is a great way to relax and connect with others, helping me find a balance between intellectual and physical pursuits.
