                <b>CPU Emulator (Java):</b></a>
                Designed and implemented a CPU emulator in Java. ​
                This project provided hands-on experience in simulating crucial components of a
                computer system, focusing on:​
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>CPU Operation:</b>Emulation of instruction execution and data manipulation.
